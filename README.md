# CIS Docker Benchmarks

## Introduction

As Docker usage has greatly increased, it has become increasingly important to gain a better understanding of how to securely configure and deploy Dockerized applications. The Center for Internet Security published 1.13 Docker Benchmarks, which provides consesus based guidance by subject matter experts for users and organizations to achieve secure Docker usage and configuration. 

We previously published a blog on how Anchore can help achieve NIST 800-190 compliance, this post will detail how Anchore can help with CIS Docker Benchmarks 1.13. 

Anchore is a service that analyzes Docker images and applies user-defined acceptance policies to allow automated container image validation and certification. The critical component in helping achieve any sort of compliance are Anchore Policy Bundles. With these, users have full control over what specific policy rules they would like their Docker images to adhere to.
